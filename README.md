# Concepts Practice
This repository consists few of my conceptual practice via various sources from the internet. Some of the notebooks here can be used to learn about the basic concepts of pandas, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Principal Components Analysis (PCA), etc. I will keep on updating this reppository as I practice other different concepts in coming days.
